						Johnson &amp; Johnson Commit to Non-Enforcement of Secondary Patents in low- and middle-income countries
					</h1>
					<p class="news-date"><em>October 3, 2023</em></p>
					<p>
						TBfighters around the world are thrilled at the <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-confirms-intent-not-to-enforce-patents-for-sirturo-bedaquiline-for-the-treatment-of-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-in-134-low-and-middle-income-countries" target="_blank">news</a> that Johnson &amp; Johnson will not enforce secondary patents for SIRTURO® (bedaquiline) in 134 low- and middle-income countries. This builds upon their agreement with the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug Facility (GDF), which allowed for generic bedaquiline in 44 countries. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s announcement means people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) will be able to access a more affordable bedaquiline-containing treatment regimen regardless of their country’s eligibility or willingness to procure drugs through the GDF.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ending secondary patent enforcement will expand access to generic bedaquiline for countries such as South Africa, Ukraine, and Belarus, all of whom have a high-burden of TB but were excluded from the agreement with the GDF, meaning that until now they faced the continuation of high prices for bedaquiline. This represents a deep commitment to global health from J&J. This change of approach will save many lives, and allow more to avoid life-changing treatment complications, and we are truly thankful.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are very glad to have played a part in this change, building upon and amplifying years of work from TB advocates and organizations, such as <a href="https://msfaccess.org/msf-calls-commitment-pharma-corporation-jj-not-enforce-extended-patents-lifesaving-tb-drug-main" target="_blank">MSF (Doctors Without Borders)</a>, <a href="https://www.pih.org/article/pih-urges-further-steps-ensure-tb-drugs-available-all" target="_blank">Partners in Health</a>, the <a href="https://www.stoptb.org/news/stop-tbs-global-drug-facility-announces-historic-price-reductions-to-55-bedaquiline-life-saving">Stop TB Partnership</a>, the <a href="https://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/" target="_blank">Treatment Action Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.compcom.co.za/" target="_blank">South African Competition Commission</a>, who launched an investigation into J&J’s bedaquiline pricing, and all those involved in the recent UN High Level Meeting on Tuberculosis, including <a href="https://unitaid.org/" target="_blank">UNITAID</a>. We look forward to working in partnership for further progress. Together, we can end TB.
